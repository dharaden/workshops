# About the Presenter

Hello!

My name is Dustin Haraden and I am an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Rochester Institute of Technology. The focus of my research is examining chronotype/circadian rhythms and sleep processes as risk factors for youth depression and anxiety. I also aim to further examine the impact of measurement upon the conclusions that can be made throughout psychological science.

I am also an advocate for open science practices and engaging in transparency throughout the research process.

Please reach out with any additional questions [(send me an email).](mailto:%20dxhgsh@rit.edu)
