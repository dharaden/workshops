The focus of my research is examining chronotype/circadian rhythms and sleep processes as risk factors for youth depression and anxiety. I also aim to further examine the impact of measurement upon the conclusions that can be made throughout psychological science.\nI am also an advocate for open science practices and engaging in transparency throughout the research process.\nPlease reach out with any additional questions (send me an email)."
