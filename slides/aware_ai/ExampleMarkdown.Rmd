```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Be Clear

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(easystats)
library(sjPlot)
library(here)
library(janitor)

school_data <- read.csv(here("slides", 
                             "aware_ai", 
                             "data", 
                             "NM-NY_CAS.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

Now that we have the data loaded in, we can begin to examine things in more detail

## Correlation

Let's first look at the correlation between select variables

```{r}
school_data %>% 
  select("ageyears", "languages_spoken") %>% 
  tab_corr()
```
