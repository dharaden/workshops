## Endogeneity

There exists a relationship between your predictors and unexplained variation (i.e., error) in your outcome

Some sources of endogeneity:

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 30px"}
-   Omitted Variables
    -   Failure to include relevant variables into the model
-   Measurement Error
    -   Constructs are measured ineffectively
-   Sample Selection
    -   The sample that was assessed was not done randomly or fails to represent the population of interest
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Endogeneity - Model Impact

Endogeneity can impact a model in a number of ways including:

-   Bias in parameter estimates

-   Inflation of standard errors

-   Spurious results

-   Sensitivity to model changes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Omitted Variables

Is it possible to have all variables included in a model?

We know that omitted variables will result in biased parameters

We are also able to potentially detect when there may be omitted variables (e.g., modification indices, residual analyses, specification tests)

***However***, it is important to be guided by a theoretical framework. This is an important foundation in model building.

# Equivalent Models - SEM

Let's assume that we have appropriately selected variables that minimize bias due to omission of variables

What happens with models that are ***equivalent***? (**Note**: Different than *alternate* models)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Alternate vs. Equivalent Models

Alternate models can be tested and compared to one another based on their model fit

When alternate models are created, they are likely to have *differences*Â in model fit

**Equivalent Models** on the other hand have different representations of the structure of the model but have ***identical*** model fit

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Equivalent Models - Example

Model 1:

![](med1.png){fig-align="center"}

. . .

Model 2:

![](med2.png){fig-align="center"}

. . .

Model 3:

![](model3.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Equivalent Models - Example

All three models shown previously are numerically equivalent despite making three clearly different claims about the reality that they represent

It is important to then go back to theory to identify which is the most useful (or least wrong going back to the quote)

**Note:** This example only includes three measured variables. The number of equivalent models will increase as the complexity of the model increases (For further reading, see Lee & Hershberger (1990). A simple rule for generating equivalent models in covariance structure modeling. *Multivariate Behavioral Research, 25*, 313-334.)

# Bus Factor Workflow

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Workflow Framework

Anyone should be able to run your analyses at any point

When working with R/R-Studio, there are some things that can be very helpful to consider:

-   Using a "Project"

-   Incorporating relative file paths

-   Implement RMarkdown as frequently as possible

The following slides will have additional resources, but now we will transition to a demo of the workflow. I will work to move back and forth between these slides and the demo

The majority of this can be found in [rstats.wtf](https://rstats.wtf/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Getting Started in R-Studio

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
It is important to start with a blank slate

Default is to have everything kept around

-   You wouldn't do this when you are baking

Navigate to ***Tools \>\> Global Options***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Setting the Boundary - Kitchen

Use a project-oriented workflow ([link](https://rstats.wtf/projects) and [another resource](https://danovando.github.io/reproducible-workflow/presentations/reproducibility-101#8))

When working on an analysis/project you will need to define where this is taking place

-   When baking, you are going to be working in your own kitchen

A Project will act as the bounds in which you will be able to "bake" in (i.e., **your** kitchen)

This means that everything you are going to want to work with will be in this Project/kitchen

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Creating your Recipe - RMarkdown

Using RMarkdown allows us to embed both regular text and code all into a single document

Upon completion, a document can be `knit` together in either a PDF, Word or HTML file to share with collaborators

![](images/clipboard-2266633380.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Be Clear - Recipe not Blog

Start every script with all appropriate libraries and information

This is where I load the data and will call the libraries that I want to use

You want to get right into the recipe and not have to read too far before getting there

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Relative Paths

> *If the first line of your R script is*

> setwd("C:\\Users\\jenny\\path\\that\\only\\I\\have")
>
> *I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE* ðŸ”¥.
>
> *If the first line of your R script is*

> rm(list = ls())

### `here` package

## Example - Regression

```{r}
student_perf <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dharaden/psyc640/main/data/Multiple_reg/Student_Performance.csv") %>%    
  clean_names()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Regression- Single Predictor

```{r}
fit1 <- lm(performance_index ~ previous_scores, 
           data = student_perf)
summary(fit1)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example - Coefficient interpretation

[sjPlot](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/tab_model_estimates.html)

```{r}
sjPlot::tab_model(fit1)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model Comparison Example

```{r, , output.lines = 1:7}
m.2 <- lm(performance_index ~ previous_scores + hours_studied, 
           data = student_perf)

m.3 <- lm(performance_index ~ previous_scores + hours_studied + sleep_hours, 
           data = student_perf)

tab_model(m.2, m.3)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model Diagnostics

### `easystats` making stats easy

Can check the model with a simple function

```{r}
check_model(m.3)
```
